This calculator has addition, subtraction, and division already implemented.

You will need to create the functionality for multiplication.

Use the other functions as an example of what to do.
Optional

See if you can find code that could be moved to a method and then reused in multiple places.


Refactor the code and run a few tests to make sure it works.


Hint: The part where the code gets the numbers to use in the math operations all look very similar.

***Make sure to INCLUDE THE LINK to YOUR NEW REPOSITORY when you turn in the assignment.
